# Introduction

On this session we will have the introduction to the course pracitalities, as well as the basic terminology.

## Course structure

The course consists of four sessions, of which this page acts as the first one. Due to the sickness leave of the teacher, the first session is only in written form. The second session will be online, as the visiting lecturer resides in Helsinki. Depending on the corona status at that point, a joint session at school might still be arranged. Third session is a normal lecture, where we shall discuss accessibility, as well as the course task will be discussed in greater detail. The fourth and final session is reserved for presentations of the course task.

## Course practicalities

The grading is **pass / fail**, and attendance is compulsory on the second and the fourth session, i.e. the visiting lecturer and your own presentation. Missing these sessions or not doing the presentation are a fail, otherwise the course is passed. Compensation due to sickness leave or similar must be discussed *in advance* with the teacher.

Sessions are:
1. *07.10.2020* from *11.30* to *16.30* - Cancelled / This text
2. *21.10.2020* from *11.30* to *16.30* - Visiting lecturer
3. *28.10.2020* from *11.30* to *16.30* - Accessibility
4. *04.11.2020* from *11.30* to *16.30* - Presentations

If you have any questions, do ask.

## UX and UI

*UX* and *UI* are often discussed in unison as they are quite related, but what are they exactly, and why is there two terms?

### UX

UX might be unfamiliar, and stands for *User *eXperience*. As the name suggests, UX is anything that can be interacted with, and the experience (or feeling) caused by it. For example, how does it feel to buy a movie ticket or a train ticket? How annoying is the pop-up for cookies on a website?

### UI

UI is already somewhat a familiar term, and is of course an abbreviation of *User Interface*. UI can be seen as anything the user sees, touches, interacts with... and so on, to use the software or any item we are designing. It could be said that if something can be interacted with, it has an interface the user can use. For example, how big buttons should we use on our application? Where should they be situated?
