# Presentations

To conclude the course, you are to present what you have learned. Each student is to give from 10 to 15 minutes presentation about a software, web page, product or item. The presentation should include at least...

* Thoughts on usability
* Consideration of user experience 
* Introduction to user interface
* Accessibility ideas
* Possible improvements, if possible

In the first section of the course, we had a small example about the subject, as follows.

## Example

For example, one could make a presentation about a washing machines. What are the experience and the user interface like at the moment? 
* The opening, is it large enough? 
* Does the machine make annoying sounds? 
* Could a blind person use it? 

For me, the experience is always tedious, as the placement of the machine at home is not optimal. I have to be crouching to load the machine. It makes annoying beeps, which then again could be helpful indicators to a blind person. The buttons are a touch screen, but it is kind of hard to use.

* How would I improve it?
* If I were to design it, would I make the same choices?

I think I am quite happy with the design, but I would make the touch buttons a bit elevated, or at least have some sort of separation between them. It is quite easy to press the wrong button. Also, the touch sensor is not that great... And so on.

Let us expand this example to meet the criteria for the presentation. The example presentation created from this can be found from Microsoft Streams, and you need Centria login to access it. A short link to the example is here: [https://bit.ly/uxui-washer](https://bit.ly/uxui-washer){:target="_blank"}

## Giving the presentation

Your task is to give a presentation of the designed item of your choice. The length should be about 10 to 15 minutes per person, and the presentations are held 4.11. from 11.30 onwards. 

Do prepare your presentation:
* Have slides
* Have pictures
* Have examples
* Have fun

The presentation is a compulsory part of the course. *If you cannot attend the lecture, you can make the presentation in advance as a video* of at least 10 minutes, and send the video or the link to it to teacher. The presentation rules apply to the video as well, as they will be watched during the lecture like other presentations.
