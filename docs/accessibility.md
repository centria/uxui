# Accessibility

In this section we will talk about accessibility. The main point of view will be from a web application perspective, but we will briefly look into accessibility from other viewpoints as well. The material consists of text, as well as links to other web sites, and videos, which will also open on external web sites.

Let's begin with a video about design. Even though the video is about kitchen gadgets and their functionality, it also works as a quite a nice introduction to accessibility. In the video, the designer tests the functionality and the usability of kitchen gadgets, to see if there is room for improvement. One of the methods he uses is for testing accessibility, and using the gadgets with his non-dominant hand, which is covered in oil. The reasoning behind this is explained in the video:

You do not have to watch the whole video to get the idea, but it's a quite fun video.

## Why is accessibility important?

There are several kinds of disabilities, and they are more common than most people might think. By estimate, 15 to 20 per cent of world's population have some kind of disability. As right to information is a human right, the software we design should also be accessible. For greater detail, watch this short video:

From the following link you can find a more accessible version of the video:

You can notice there are quite a variety of accessible versions for one video. Of course, it would probably not be reasonable to have all the possible versions in all the websites in the world, but the link above shows how different versions could be implemented on a web site.

Accessibility is not only taking the disabilites into consideration. Accessible design means also considering the positioning of elements, readibility of fonts and good structure of the software, for example.

## Accessibility guidelines

There are multiple guidelines for accessibility available. We will look at two of them. The content of those guidelines will not be copied to this site, but opening the external links for them is required. 

The first guideline is the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG. It contains very much, very detailed information. Going through all of the information on the page is not enough, but do open a few links on the site as well. Especially the resource link "How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)" on the first page is quite interesting. 

You can find the WCAG from the following address: [https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

Another important guideline is the Web Accessibility Directive for European Union. It is meant to provide people with disabilities with better access to the websites and mobile apps of public services. 

The Directive

* covers websites and apps of public sector bodies, with a limited number of exceptions (e.g. broadcasters, live streaming);
* refers to specific standards to make websites and mobile apps more accessible. Such standards require for instance that there should be a text description for images, or that users are able to interact with a website without using a mouse, which can be difficult for some people with disabilities;
* requires the publication of an accessibility statement for each website and mobile app, describing the level of accessibility and indicating any content that is not accessible;
* calls for a feedback mechanism which the users can use to flag accessibility problems or to ask for the information contained in a non-accessible content;
* expects regular monitoring of public sector websites and apps by Member States, and that they report on the results of the monitoring. These reports have to be communicated to the Commission and to be made public for the first time by 23 December 2021.

A quick guide to the directive, from which the list above has been quoted, can be found from here: [https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/web-accessibility](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/web-accessibility)

The directive is quite a long and hard read, but if you are interested in the legal side, you can find the full directive from the next link: [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L2102&from=EN](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L2102&from=EN)

## Accessibility tools

Screen readers

Even though we try to make our applications as accessible as possible, there might still be some features we forget to take into consideration. Next let's practice this in action.

## Voluntary exercises

Open a screen reader of your choice on this web page. Can you use the page, only navigating with the screen reader. Now close your eyes and do it again. Can you still do it? 

Udacity offers a free short and awesome course about usability. Doing the exercises are voluntary, but I strongly recommend you do them at some point. You can find the course from this link: [https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891)
